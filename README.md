The repository contains a WIP version of the logic under the ArkhamHorror LCG.

By the moment the code is only being tested, not implemented anywhere. Therefore is no functionality exposed in the main.

There is a small dataset with the cards is the data folder. For that data I am using the https://arkhamdb.com/ website and manually creating my own dataset.

The purpose of the project is to really understand the game and get my hands dirty on programming while having fun.
